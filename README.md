# Hi Alexandra! Welcome to Your FizzBuzz TDD Journey! 🎯

This is your personal coding playground where you'll learn Test-Driven Development (TDD) and professional software development practices. I've set this up especially for you!

## 🌟 What You'll Master Today

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - The professional way to write bulletproof code
- **Git & GitHub** - How real developers save and share their work
- **Professional Tools** - Code quality tools that companies actually use
- **Creative Web Development** - Make something beautiful that you can show off!
- **Confidence Building** - You'll see your code work step by step

## 🚀 Let's Get You Started!

### Before We Begin

Make sure you have these installed:
- **VS Code** - Your coding environment (we'll set this up perfectly for you)
- **Node.js** (version 16+) - The engine that runs JavaScript
- **Git** - For saving your progress

### Your First Steps

1. **Open this project in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. **Install all the coding tools:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run your first test (it will fail - and that's perfect!):**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Follow the VS Code setup guide** in [`docs/VSCODE_SETUP.md`](docs/VSCODE_SETUP.md) to get the best coding experience!

### Start Here, Alexandra!

1. **First**: Read [`docs/VSCODE_SETUP.md`](docs/VSCODE_SETUP.md) to make coding easier
2. **Curious about all these files?**: Check out [`docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) 
3. **What are Jest, ESLint, etc?**: See [`docs/TOOLS_GLOSSARY.md`](docs/TOOLS_GLOSSARY.md) for explanations
4. **Then**: Open [`docs/TDD_TUTORIAL.md`](docs/TDD_TUTORIAL.md) - this is your step-by-step guide
5. **Finally**: Have fun and don't worry about making mistakes - that's how we learn!

## 🎯 Your Mission: The FizzBuzz Challenge

You're going to build a function that's both fun and teaches you real programming skills:

- **Input 3** → Output "Fizz"
- **Input 5** → Output "Buzz"  
- **Input 15** → Output "FizzBuzz"
- **Any other number** → Output the number as text

Sound simple? It is! But you'll learn to build it the **professional way** using TDD.

## 🛠️ Your Coding Toolkit

These are the commands you'll use. Don't worry about memorizing them - just bookmark this page!

```bash
npm test              # Run your tests (you'll use this A LOT!)
npm run test:watch    # Tests run automatically when you save
npm run test:coverage # See how much of your code is tested
npm run lint          # Check if your code follows best practices
npm run format        # Make your code look professional
npm run serve         # See your web page locally
```

## 🌈 Make It Yours!

Once you've mastered the basics, make this project uniquely yours:
- Change the colors to your favorites
- Add animations and effects
- Create themes inspired by your art
- Add sounds or music
- Make it responsive for phones

This isn't just a coding exercise - it's your first real web application!

## 🎉 You've Got This!

Remember Alexandra:
- **Every expert was once a beginner**
- **Mistakes are how we learn** - embrace them!
- **Small steps lead to big achievements**
- **Your creativity makes you unique as a developer**
