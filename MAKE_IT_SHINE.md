## 🌟 Time to See Your Creation Come to Life!

You've built an amazing FizzBuzz function using professional TDD practices. Now let's connect it to a beautiful web interface so you can see it in action and show it off to the world!

## 🚀 Launch Your Web Interface

**Let's see what you've built!**

**1. Start your local server:**
```bash
npm run serve
```

**2. Open your web browser and go to:**
```
http://localhost:8080
```

**🎉 What do you see?** A beautiful, modern web interface for your FizzBuzz function!

## 🔍 Understanding What You're Looking At

**Your web interface includes:**
- ✨ **Input field** - Enter any number to test your function
- 🎯 **Generate button** - Run FizzBuzz on your number
- 📊 **Range display** - See FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to any number
- 🎨 **Beautiful styling** - Modern gradients and animations

## 🔗 How It All Connects

**Let's peek under the hood!** Open these files to see how everything works together:

### `index.html` - Your Web Page Structure
This file creates the visual layout. Look for these key elements:
- Input field for numbers
- Button to trigger FizzBuzz
- Display area for results

### `app.js` - The Connection Magic  
This file connects your FizzBuzz function to the web interface:
```javascript
const fizzbuzz = require('./src/fizzbuzz');  // Imports your function!
```

**🤔 Cool discovery:** The same function you wrote for tests now powers a web app!

### `style.css` - The Beauty Layer
This makes everything look amazing with:
- Modern gradients and colors
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design for phones and tablets

## 🎮 Test Your Web Interface

**Try these experiments:**

1. **Single numbers:**
   - Enter `3` → Should show "Fizz"
   - Enter `5` → Should show "Buzz"  
   - Enter `15` → Should show "FizzBuzz"
   - Enter `7` → Should show "7"

2. **Range display:**
   - Enter `20` and click "Generate Range"
   - Watch your FizzBuzz sequence come to life!

3. **Edge cases:**
   - Try `0`, `1`, `100`
   - See how your function handles different inputs

**🎉 Everything working as expected?** Your code is running in a real web application!

.fizz, .buzz {
  animation: pulse 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.05); }
}
```
