# Development Tools Glossary üõ†Ô∏è

Hi Alexandra! You'll see many tool names mentioned throughout this project. This guide explains what each tool does and why it's helpful for your development journey!

## üß™ Testing Tools

### **Jest**
**What it is:** A JavaScript testing framework created by Facebook  
**What it does:** Runs your tests and tells you if your code works correctly  
**Why you need it:** Catches bugs before they reach users  
**In this project:** Runs the tests in your `test/` folder  

**Example:** When you run `npm test`, Jest:
- Finds all `.test.js` files
- Runs each test function
- Shows green ‚úÖ for passing tests, red ‚ùå for failing ones
- Gives you detailed error messages

**Cool features:**
- **Watch mode** (`npm run test:watch`) - automatically runs tests when you save files
- **Coverage reports** - shows which parts of your code are tested
- **Snapshot testing** - compares output to saved "snapshots"

## üìù Code Quality Tools

### **ESLint**
**What it is:** A "linter" that analyzes your JavaScript code  
**What it does:** Finds potential bugs and style issues before you run your code  
**Why you need it:** Prevents common mistakes and keeps code consistent  
**In this project:** Configured in `.eslintrc.js`

**What ESLint catches:**
- Unused variables (`let x = 5; // but never use x`)
- Missing semicolons
- Potential bugs (like `if (x = 5)` instead of `if (x === 5)`)
- Style inconsistencies

**Visual feedback:** Red squiggly lines in VS Code when something's wrong

### **Prettier**
**What it is:** An "auto-formatter" for your code  
**What it does:** Makes your code look professional and consistent  
**Why you need it:** No more arguing about spaces vs tabs!  
**In this project:** Configured in `.prettierrc`

**Magic trick:** Save a messy file and watch it become perfectly formatted instantly!

**Before Prettier:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number){if(number%3===0&&number%5===0){return"FizzBuzz"}else if(number%3===0){return"Fizz"}
return number.toString()}
```

**After Prettier:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  if (number % 3 === 0 && number % 5 === 0) {
    return 'FizzBuzz';
  } else if (number % 3 === 0) {
    return 'Fizz';
  }
  return number.toString();
}
```

## üîÑ Build Tools

### **Babel**
**What it is:** A JavaScript "transpiler"  
**What it does:** Converts modern JavaScript to work in older browsers  
**Why you need it:** Lets you use the latest JavaScript features  
**In this project:** Configured in `babel.config.js`

**Example:** Babel converts this modern code:
```javascript
const greet = (name = 'World') => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

Into this older-compatible code:
```javascript
var greet = function greet(name) {
  if (name === undefined) name = 'World';
  return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
};
```

### **npm (Node Package Manager)**
**What it is:** The package manager for JavaScript  
**What it does:** Downloads and manages external libraries  
**Why you need it:** Gives you access to millions of code packages  
**In this project:** Manages all dependencies in `package.json`

## üåê Web Development Tools

### **HTTP Server**
**What it is:** A simple web server  
**What it does:** Serves your HTML files locally  
**Why you need it:** See your web page in a browser  
**In this project:** Run with `npm run serve`

**Why not just open HTML files?** Some features only work with a proper server (like importing modules).

### **Live Server (VS Code Extension)**
**What it is:** A VS Code extension  
**What it does:** Auto-refreshes your browser when you save files  
**Why it's awesome:** See changes instantly without manual refresh

## üé® Design & CSS Tools

### **CSS Variables (Custom Properties)**
**What they are:** Variables in CSS that you can reuse  
**What they do:** Let you change colors/values in one place  
**Why they're cool:** Easy theming and consistency  

**Example in this project:**
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #667eea;
  --fizz-color: #f093fb;
}

.fizz {
  background: var(--fizz-color); /* Uses the variable */
}
```

### **CSS Grid & Flexbox**
**What they are:** Modern CSS layout systems  
**What they do:** Make responsive layouts easy  
**Why they're better:** No more float hacks!

**Grid** (used for the FizzBuzz results):
```css
.result-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(80px, 1fr));
  gap: 15px;
}
```

## üîß Git & Version Control

### **Git**
**What it is:** A version control system  
**What it does:** Tracks changes to your code over time  
**Why you need it:** Never lose work, collaborate safely  

**Key concepts:**
- **Repository (repo):** Your project folder with Git tracking
- **Commit:** A saved snapshot of your changes
- **Branch:** A separate line of development
- **Push:** Send changes to GitHub
- **Pull:** Get latest changes from GitHub

### **GitHub**
**What it is:** A cloud platform for Git repositories  
**What it does:** Stores your code online and enables collaboration  
**Why it's essential:** Backup, sharing, and professional portfolios

## ü§ñ Automation Tools

### **GitHub Actions**
**What it is:** GitHub's automation platform  
**What it does:** Runs tasks automatically when you push code  
**Why it's powerful:** No manual deployment or testing  

**In this project:**
- **tests.yml** - Runs your tests on every push
- **deploy.yml** - Publishes your website automatically

### **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
**What it is:** A development practice  
**What it does:** Automatically tests and deploys code  
**Why it matters:** Catch problems early, deploy confidently

**The flow:**
1. You push code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions runs your tests
3. If tests pass, code gets deployed
4. Your website updates automatically!

**What it contains:**
- Project information (name, version)
- Scripts (npm commands)
- Dependencies (external libraries)

### **package-lock.json**
**What it is:** Exact versions of all dependencies  
**Why it exists:** Ensures everyone gets the same versions

## üéØ Testing Concepts

### **Unit Tests**
**What they are:** Tests that check individual functions  
**Example:** Testing that `fizzbuzz(3)` returns `"Fizz"`

### **Test Coverage**

**Goal:** Higher coverage = more confidence in your code  
**Command:** `npm run test:coverage`

### **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
**What it is:** Write tests before writing code  
**The cycle:** Red (failing test) ‚Üí Green (make it pass) ‚Üí Refactor (improve)
