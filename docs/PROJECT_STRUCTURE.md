## 🎯 Core Files (What You'll Work With)

### Your Code Files

**📄 src/fizzbuzz.js**
- **What:** Your main FizzBuzz function
- **Why:** Separating source code from tests is a professional practice
- **You'll:** Write your fizzbuzz logic here using TDD

**📄 test/fizzbuzz.test.js**
- **What:** Tests that verify your code works
- **Why:** Tests catch bugs and guide development
- **You'll:** Add more tests as you build features

**📄 index.html**
- **What:** Your web page structure
- **Why:** Makes your project visually accessible
- **You'll:** See your FizzBuzz results in a beautiful interface

**📄 style.css**
- **What:** Makes your web page beautiful
- **Why:** Visual design is part of development
- **You'll:** Customize colors, animations, and themes

**📄 app.js**
- **What:** Connects your FizzBuzz logic to the web interface

- **You'll:** Hook up your function to make the web page work

## ⚙️ Configuration Files (The Professional Setup)

### Testing Configuration

**📄 jest.config.js**
```javascript
// This tells Jest (our testing tool) how to work
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',        // Run tests in Node.js
  collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.js'], // Track which code is tested
  coverageThreshold: {            // Require 80% of code to be tested
    global: { branches: 80, functions: 80, lines: 80 }
  }
};
```
- **What:** Configuration for Jest testing framework
- **Why:** Ensures tests run correctly and maintains quality standards
- **Benefit:** You get detailed test reports and coverage metrics
- **Learn more:** See `docs/TOOLS_GLOSSARY.md` for detailed Jest explanation

**📄 babel.config.js**
```javascript
// This lets us use modern JavaScript features
module.exports = {
  presets: [['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}]],
};
```
- **What:** Transpiles modern JavaScript for compatibility
- **Why:** Lets you use latest JavaScript features
- **Benefit:** Your code works everywhere

### Code Quality Tools

**📄 .eslintrc.js**
```javascript
// This catches potential bugs and enforces coding standards
module.exports = {
  env: { browser: true, es2021: true, node: true, jest: true },
  extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'prettier'],
  rules: {
    'no-console': 'warn',        // Warn about console.log
    'no-unused-vars': 'error',   // Error on unused variables
    'prefer-const': 'error'      // Prefer const over let
  }
};
```
- **What:** Rules for writing clean, consistent code
- **Why:** Catches bugs before they happen
- **Benefit:** Your code follows professional standards

**📄 .prettierrc**
```json
{
  "semi": true,           // Always use semicolons
  "singleQuote": true,    // Use single quotes
  "printWidth": 80,       // Wrap lines at 80 characters
  "tabWidth": 2           // Use 2 spaces for indentation
}
```
- **What:** Automatic code formatting rules
- **Why:** Consistent, beautiful code without thinking about it
- **Benefit:** Your code always looks professional

### Project Information

**📄 package.json**
```json
{
  "name": "fizzbuzz-kata",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",              // npm test runs Jest
    "lint": "eslint .",          // npm run lint checks code quality
    "format": "prettier --write ." // npm run format beautifies code
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^29.7.0",           // Testing framework
    "eslint": "^9.0.0",          // Code quality checker
    "prettier": "^3.2.0"         // Code formatter
  }
}
```
- **What:** Project metadata and dependencies
- **Why:** Defines what tools your project needs
- **Benefit:** Anyone can install and run your project

**📄 package-lock.json**
- **What:** Exact versions of all dependencies
- **Why:** Ensures everyone gets the same versions
- **Benefit:** No "works on my machine" problems
- **Note:** You never edit this manually - npm manages it

**📄 .gitignore**
```
node_modules/    # Don't track installed packages
coverage/        # Don't track test coverage reports
.env            # Don't track secret keys
```

## 💡 Alexandra's Development Journey

**Phase 1 (Now):** Focus on `src/` and `test/` - build your FizzBuzz function

**Phase 2 (Soon):** Connect to `index.html` and `app.js` - make it visual

**Phase 3 (Later):** Customize `style.css` - make it beautiful and unique

**Phase 4 (Advanced):** Explore `exercises/` - challenge yourself

**Phase 5 (Pro):** Understand all config files - become a setup expert

## 🎉 You're Learning Real Development!

Every file in this project serves a purpose in professional development:
- **Configuration files** automate boring tasks
- **Documentation** helps others (and future you) understand the project
- **Automation** prevents human errors
- **Structure** keeps complex projects organized

Don't worry about understanding everything immediately. Focus on your FizzBuzz function, and as you grow as a developer, you'll appreciate why each piece is there!

## 🔍 Quick Reference

**Need to find something?**
- **Your code:** `src/fizzbuzz.js`
