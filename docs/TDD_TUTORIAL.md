```

Right now you have:
- **Empty fizzbuzz.js** - Like a blank scroll waiting for your technique
- **One test** - Your first training challenge
- **All tools ready** - Jest (your sensei), ESLint (your mentor), Prettier (your style master)

---

## 🥋 Chapter 1: Face Your First Challenge

### Step 1: See the Challenge (RED 🔴)

**What you're doing:** Running your first test to see it fail

**Think of it like:** Meeting your first training opponent - you're supposed to lose at first!

**Your mission:**
1. Open your terminal in VS Code (`Terminal` → `New Terminal`)
2. Type the magic command:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
3. Watch what happens!

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You as 🧙‍♀️ Alexandra
    participant Terminal as 💻 Terminal
    participant Jest as 🧪 Jest Sensei
    participant Test as 📝 Your Test
    
    You->>Terminal: npm test
    Terminal->>Jest: Wake up, sensei!
    Jest->>Test: What challenge do we have?
    Test->>Jest: Check if fizzbuzz(1) returns "1"
    Jest->>Jest: Looking for fizzbuzz function...
    Jest->>You: ❌ ERROR: fizzbuzz is not defined!
```

**What you'll see (don't panic!):**
```
ReferenceError: fizzbuzz is not defined
```

**Translation:** "I don't know what 'fizzbuzz' is - you haven't created it yet!"

**This is PERFECT!** 🎉 Like in manga when the hero first faces an impossible challenge - this failure tells you exactly what you need to learn!

### Step 2: Your First Victory (GREEN 🟢)

**What you're doing:** Creating the fizzbuzz function to make the test pass

**Think of it like:** Learning your first technique to defeat the opponent

**Your mission:**
1. Open `src/fizzbuzz.js`
2. Look at what the test expects:
   ```javascript
   expect(fizzbuzz(1)).toBe('1');
   ```
3. Create the simplest solution that works

**What the test is asking:**
- "When I give fizzbuzz the number 1, I want it to give me back the string '1'"

**Your first technique (write this in fizzbuzz.js):**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  return '1';  // Simple but effective - like a basic punch!
}

module.exports = fizzbuzz;
```

**Now test your technique:**
```bash
npm test
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[🧪 Jest Sensei] --> B[📝 Runs Your Test]
    B --> C{"🤔 Does fizzbuzz(1)<br/>return '1'?"}
    C -->|Yes! ✅| D[🎉 SUCCESS!<br/>First Victory!]
    C -->|No ❌| E[💪 Try Again!]
    
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
    style E fill:#ffcdd2
```

**Victory moment!** 🎊 You should see:
```
✅ returns "1" when given 1
```

Like Goku throwing his first successful Kamehameha - it's basic, but it WORKS!

### Step 3: Save Your Progress (Commit) 💎

**What you're doing:** Creating a save point in your adventure

**Think of it like:** Saving your game after beating a boss

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: fizzbuzz returns '1' for input 1"
```

```mermaid

## 🥋 Chapter 2: Level Up Your Technique

### The Next Challenge Appears 🔴

**Your growth mindset:** "What's the next simplest thing my function should handle?"

**Think about the FizzBuzz rules:**
- Regular numbers → return as string
- Numbers divisible by 3 → return "Fizz"
- Numbers divisible by 5 → return "Buzz"
- Numbers divisible by both → return "FizzBuzz"

**Your next opponent:** Make it work for number 2

**Add this test to `test/fizzbuzz.test.js`:**
```javascript
test('returns "2" when given 2', () => {
  expect(fizzbuzz(2)).toBe('2');
});
```

**Run the test:**
```bash
npm test
```

**What happens:** The new test fails! Your function only knows how to return '1'

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[🧪 Jest Tests Both] --> B[✅ Test 1: Passes]
    A --> C[❌ Test 2: Fails]
    C --> D[Expected: '2'<br/>Received: '1']
    
    style B fill:#c8e6c9
    style C fill:#ffcdd2
```

### Evolve Your Technique 🟢

**Think like a strategist:** How can you handle both 1 AND 2?

**The revelation:** Return the number as a string!

**Update your fizzbuzz.js:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  return number.toString();  // Works for any number!
}

module.exports = fizzbuzz;
```

**Test your evolved technique:**
```bash
npm test
```

**Both tests should pass!** ✅✅

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[🧪 Jest Tests Everything] --> B["✅ fizzbuzz(1) returns '1'"]
    A --> C["✅ fizzbuzz(2) returns '2'"]
    B --> D[🎉 All Tests Passing!]
    C --> D
    
    style D fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Save your new power:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: fizzbuzz returns string for any number"
```

## 🥋 Chapter 3: Face the Fizz Challenge

### The Plot Thickens 🔴

**Your next challenge:** Numbers divisible by 3 should return "Fizz"

**Add this test:**
```javascript
test('returns "Fizz" when given 3', () => {
  expect(fizzbuzz(3)).toBe('Fizz');
});
```

**Run the test - it will fail!**
```
Expected: "Fizz"
Received: "3"
```

Your current technique isn't enough for this new challenge!

### Develop New Abilities 🟢

**Strategy time:** You need to check if a number is divisible by 3

**The technique:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  if (number === 3) {
    return 'Fizz';
  }
  return number.toString();
}
```

**Test it:** This passes for 3, but what about 6, 9, 12?

**Add another test for 6:**
```javascript
test('returns "Fizz" when given 6', () => {
  expect(fizzbuzz(6)).toBe('Fizz');
});
```

**This will fail!** Time to generalize your technique:

```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  if (number % 3 === 0) {  // The modulo operator - checks if divisible by 3
    return 'Fizz';
  }
  return number.toString();
}
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[📊 Number Comes In] --> B{🤔 Is number % 3 === 0?}

    B -->|No| D[📝 Return number as string]
    
    style C fill:#fce4ec
    style D fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Save your Fizz mastery:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: fizzbuzz returns 'Fizz' for multiples of 3"
```

## 🥋 Chapter 4: The Buzz Technique

### New Opponent Appears 🔴

**Challenge:** Numbers divisible by 5 should return "Buzz"

**Your test:**
```javascript
test('returns "Buzz" when given 5', () => {
  expect(fizzbuzz(5)).toBe('Buzz');
});
```

### Master the Buzz 🟢

**Your evolved technique:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  if (number % 3 === 0) {
    return 'Fizz';
  }
  if (number % 5 === 0) {
    return 'Buzz';
  }
  return number.toString();
}
```

## 🥋 Chapter 5: The Ultimate Technique - FizzBuzz!

### The Final Boss Challenge 🔴

**The ultimate test:** What happens with 15? (Divisible by both 3 AND 5)

**Add the test:**
```javascript
test('returns "FizzBuzz" when given 15', () => {
  expect(fizzbuzz(15)).toBe('FizzBuzz');
});
```

**Run it - it fails!** Returns "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz"

**Why?** Your code checks 3 first, finds it's true, and returns "Fizz" without checking 5!

### Master the Ultimate Technique 🟢

**The secret:** Check for BOTH conditions first!

```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  if (number % 3 === 0 && number % 5 === 0) {  // Check both first!
    return 'FizzBuzz';
  }
  if (number % 3 === 0) {
    return 'Fizz';
  }
  if (number % 5 === 0) {
    return 'Buzz';
  }
  return number.toString();
}
```

```

**All tests should pass!** You've mastered the basic FizzBuzz technique! 🎊

**Save your mastery:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: fizzbuzz handles FizzBuzz for multiples of both 3 and 5"
```

## 🚀 Advanced Training: The Range Technique

### Power-Up Challenge 🔴

**Your growth:** Create a function that handles multiple numbers at once

**Add this test:**
```javascript
describe('FizzBuzz Range', () => {
  test('returns array for range 1 to 5', () => {
    expect(fizzbuzzRange(1, 5)).toEqual(['1', '2', 'Fizz', '4', 'Buzz']);
  });
});
```

### Develop Your Range Power 🟢

**Add to your fizzbuzz.js:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzzRange(start, end) {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    results.push(fizzbuzz(i));
  }
  return results;
}

// Export both functions
module.exports = { fizzbuzz, fizzbuzzRange };
```

**Update your test import:**
```javascript
const { fizzbuzz, fizzbuzzRange } = require('../src/fizzbuzz');
```

```mermaid

## 🆘 Troubleshooting: When Your Code Rebels

### Common Boss Battles & How to Win 💪

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[😱 Error Appears!] --> B[📖 Read Error Message<br/>Carefully]
    B --> C{"🤔 What Type<br/>of Error?"}
    C -->|Syntax Error| D[🔍 Check Brackets,<br/>Commas, Quotes]
    C -->|Reference Error| E[🔍 Check Function/<br/>Variable Names]

    D --> G[🔧 Fix and<br/>Test Again]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[🎉 Victory!]
```

**Error Translation Guide:**
- `fizzbuzz is not defined` → "Create the fizzbuzz function"
- `Unexpected token` → "Check your syntax - missing bracket or comma"
- `Expected "Fizz" but received "3"` → "Your logic needs adjustment"

### When Tests Fail 🧪❌

**Your debugging jutsu:**
1. **Read the story** - Error messages tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **One at a time** - Fix one test before moving to the next
3. **Use console.log** - Add `console.log(number)` to see what you're getting
4. **Check the math** - Is 15 % 3 really equal to 0? Test it!

**Example debugging:**
```javascript
function fizzbuzz(number) {
  console.log('Input:', number);  // See what's coming in
  console.log('Divisible by 3?', number % 3 === 0);  // Check your logic
  // ... rest of your code
}
```
